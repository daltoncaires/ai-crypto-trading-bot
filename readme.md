# AI Crypto Trading Bot

This is a minimal, modular AI-powered crypto trading bot for learning, experimentation, and rapid prototyping. It combines AI decision-making with real-time and historical crypto market data for automated trading strategies.

## What does it do?
- Loads and manages coin, order, and portfolio data using simple JSON-based DALs (Data Access Layers).
- Fetches live and historical price data from CoinGecko.
- Uses OpenAI to generate buy/sell recommendations based on market context and configurable prompts.
- Simulates trading logic, including buy/sell handling, portfolio updates, and PnL tracking.
- Includes a backtesting module to evaluate AI-driven strategies on historical data.
- All configuration is handled via environment variables for easy tuning.

## How is it built?
- **Python 3.11+**: All modules are written in Python for clarity and extensibility.
- **Modular Structure**: Data access, services, and worker logic are separated for maintainability and reusability.
- **CoinGecko API**: Used for fetching market data and pool information.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for generating trading recommendations.
- **Minimal DALs**: All data is stored in simple JSON files, managed by minimal, DRY data access layers.
- **Backtesting**: Simulates AI recommendations over historical price data to evaluate strategy performance.
- **No Docker Required**: Runs natively in any Python environment.

## Possible Improvements

- **Async Support**: Refactor data access and service calls to use Python's `asyncio` for improved performance and scalability, especially when dealing with network APIs and I/O.
- **Postgres Database**: Replace JSON file storage with a robust relational database like PostgreSQL for better scalability, reliability, and concurrent access.
- **Dockerization**: Add Docker support for easy deployment and reproducible environments across different systems.
- **Advanced Logging**: Integrate Python's `logging` module for better error tracking, debugging, and monitoring.
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: Add automated tests to ensure reliability and facilitate future development.
- **Web Dashboard**: Build a simple web dashboard (e.g., with FastAPI or Flask) to visualize trades, portfolio, and bot status in real time.
- **Strategy Plugins**: Support for pluggable trading strategies and AI models for more flexible experimentation.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Prepare for deployment on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability and remote management.
